EXPERIENCE
----------

2016 (4 months) -  [Pick PETE](http://pickpete.com)

> **Senior Full Stack Developer**

Imagine fantasy league but for reality television. Built on a Rails/Ember stack I had the opportunity to deep dive into both frameworks and oversee a small team. In a small amount of time we were able to build out a killer new feature at the same time optimising and scaling the existing codebase and infrastructure.

2013 - 2016 - [Papercloud](https://www.papercloud.com.au)

> **Software Developer**

Ruby/Javascript developer. Working for an agency I got to work on a variety of small to large scale projects. Developed primarily backend API’s as well as front end web applications. But had a lot of exposure to a variety of software ranging from Ember.js to iOS.

2010 - 2012 - [PSDtoBootstrap](https://www.psdtobootstrap.com)

> **Lead Developer**

Had the opportunity to work for myself building a large amount of quality HTML templates. I built templates with Twitter Bootstrap as the foundation. This period of my life was amazing with developing my frontend skills and the education was priceless. 

SOME PAST WORK
----------
[**NBC MatchMaker**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nbc-sports-matchmaker/id952349002?mt=8): Built and optimized a backend stack that supports both our iOS and Android apps which has now grown to over 30,000 users. Was built with scale in mind, endpoints were properly speed and load tested. And utilized Redis as our memcache to improve load times. 

[**My Healthy Travel**](myhealthytravel.com.au): Had the amazing opportunity to spearhead development on a web application in Ember.js. The framework is great example of frontend development done right, the testing framework and the ease that you could mock API endpoints increased productivity immensely.

THINGS OF NOTE
----------
	- I love to use TDD
	- commit messages are important
	
CODE I'M PROUD OF
----------
**social_auth** - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Papercloud/social_auth)
 Login with FB/Twitter/G+ was such a recurring feature over all our iOS/Android but we didn’t have a common standard to use across all our API. Each time we were essentially rewriting both Rails and iOS to do the samething.

**notify_user** - [Github Repo](https://github.com/Papercloud/notify_user)
The backbone of all our backend applications at Papercloud. It’s responsible for managing/sending notifications (web/apns/gcm) to all our users. In use in applications with over 200,000 users. Also handles all our notification aggregation.
